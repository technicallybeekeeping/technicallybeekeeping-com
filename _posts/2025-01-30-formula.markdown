# Experimenting with Vaporization Formulas for Smoky Scents

As I've mentioned in my video of the [Electric Bee Smoker](https://youtu.be/Z4yzM0qAfn8), I've been working on vaporization formulas that smell like smoke. I've found that campfire smoke scents with woody undertones work well. Ash and tar-like aromas contribute to the authenticity, and oils containing liquid smoke extract are particularly effective.

## Example Formulation:

### Ingredients:
- **60% Vegetable Glycerin (VG)** ‚Äì Provides thick vapor and smoothness  
- **30% Propylene Glycol (PG)** ‚Äì Enhances flavor and aroma diffusion  
- **5-10% Wood Vinegar (Pyroligneous Acid, Food-Grade Only)** ‚Äì Adds an authentic smoky scent  
- **Optional:** 2-5 drops **Cade Oil (rectified)** or **Guaiacwood Essential Oil** ‚Äì Enhances smokiness  

I've also experimented with **Vetiver Essential Oil**, which adds an earthy depth to the aroma. Additionally, **nicotine** is a known insect repellent, making me wonder whether the pipe-smoking beekeepers of the past benefited from its properties or if their breath‚Äîcontaining CO‚ÇÇ‚Äîhelped disperse bees.  

Stu Taylor had an interesting invention called the **Hive Bomb**. It was an aerosol that seemed to work well on bees. His [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US2900300) describes the use of hardwood tars and how bees react similarly to smoke. I have heard a rumor that this product was taken off the market due to concerns in California about aerosolized tar causing cancer in humans. Some essential oil tars, like **Birch Tar**, are designed to be vaporized without carcinogenic effects and make great alternatives.

## Criteria for Evaluating Reactions Against a Traditional Smoker:

1. Do the bees change their behavior at all?  
2. Does the smoke drive the bees down into the frames?  
3. Is there an **engorging reaction**? And how big is the reaction?  
4. There's a **buzz of recognition** that the whole hive does when you smoke into a box. It is a distinct noise where the majority of the bees buzz at the same time.  
5. Does the smoker also **mask the alarm pheromones**?
